## 👋 Hi, I'm Salik Ridwan

I'm an embedded systems engineer focused on simulation-first development, safety-critical systems, and platform-level abstraction. My work centers around virtualized environments like **E3 (Embedded Environment Emulation)**, **vHIL (Virtual Hardware-in-the-Loop)**, and **VHP (Virtual Hardware Platforms)**—with a strong interest in system determinism, coordination correctness, and embedded OS behavior under drift.

### 💡 What I Do
- ⚙️ Develop tooling for embedded and IoT simulation, removing the need for physical hardware during early-stage development and testing.
- 🛡️ Certified in cybersecurity, with particular focus on runtime safety layers and secure-by-design frameworks.
- 🧠 Building software abstractions that operate close to the metal—but without ever having touched a microcontroller directly.
- 🧭 Studying clock drift theory and its real-world implications for synchronization, timing models, and distributed coordination.
- 🤖 Exploring AI integrations with embedded environments, especially in testing and simulation loops.

### 📌 Projects
- **ECLIPSE** — A zero-cost embedded simulation lab for Linux/Windows. Virtual twins of Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms.  
- **RE:AL** — Neural singing synthesis with lyric-to-melody conversion and voice modulation.  
- **ZERO** — A certifiable safety layer enforcing deterministic behavior on imperfect hardware, without modifying the kernel.
